I implement Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) to play the Atari game using Tensorflow.

The game board is shown below: (in order to train more quickly, you can comment the syntax *env.render()* in the code)

With 5000 times of iteration, I can finally get a satisfactory result.

The environment required:
- gym
- gym[atari]
- tensorflow
- keras
