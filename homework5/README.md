This folder contains the code of hw5 in AU332.

This homework lets us running several machine learning algorithms to do the classification (output the predicted *Cover_Type*) using *sklearn* and test on the dataset which is from the forests located in Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado and provided
by US Geological Survey and USFS. 

We implemented six algorithms: Random Forest, Extra Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and Logistic Regression. Also, I use k-fold cross validation 
to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. 

Among them, Random Forest and Extra Tree behave best, with the accuracy higher than 86%.
